Vice with scripting.


    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --enable-sdlui --enable-embedded --disable-lame
    make
    src/x64 -script test.py

## Usage ideas

* Automated testing of software
* Play text games online / through SSH
* Make long scripted demo shows
* Deluxe versions of games or demos that warps through loader parts & swaps disks automatically
* Debug overlays on screen
* Automated screenshot, audio dumping etc of many files
